# Project Cobra - Technical Architecture

## System Architecture Overview

Project Cobra follows a modern microservices architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and security. The system is composed of several key components that work together to provide a comprehensive credit repair platform.

## Core Components

### Frontend Layer
- **Technology**: Next.js 14 with App Router, React, TypeScript
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Key Features**:
  - Server-side rendering for improved SEO and performance
  - Client-side interactivity for dynamic user experiences
  - Responsive design for all device types
  - Progressive Web App capabilities

### Backend Services
- **Technology**: NestJS, TypeORM, PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: AWS ECS with Auto Scaling
- **Key Services**:
  - **Client API**: Handles client-facing operations
  - **Admin API**: Provides administrative capabilities
  - **OCR Service**: Processes documents and extracts data
  - **Billing Service**: Manages subscriptions and payments

### Data Layer
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (AWS RDS)
- **Caching**: Redis
- **File Storage**: AWS S3
- **Search**: Elasticsearch (for advanced dispute and document search)

### Infrastructure
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry

## Service Interactions

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials to the Client API
2. API validates credentials and issues JWT
3. JWT is stored in secure, HTTP-only cookie
4. Subsequent requests include JWT for authentication
5. Admin routes require additional role-based verification

### Dispute Creation Flow
1. User uploads credit report through frontend
2. OCR Service processes the document
3. Extracted data is stored in PostgreSQL
4. Violation detection identifies potential issues
5. User reviews and confirms dispute details
6. System generates appropriate dispute letters
7. Dispute is tracked through resolution

### Billing Flow
1. User selects subscription plan
2. System redirects to Stripe Checkout
3. Stripe handles payment processing
4. Webhook notifies system of successful payment
5. User's subscription is activated
6. Feature access is granted based on subscription tier

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- API services are stateless and can scale horizontally
- Load balancers distribute traffic across service instances
- Auto-scaling groups adjust capacity based on demand

### Database Scaling
- Read replicas for high-read operations
- Connection pooling to manage database connections
- Sharding strategy for future growth

### Processing Intensive Operations
- OCR processing uses queue-based architecture
- Background workers handle document processing
- Results are stored and made available asynchronously

## Security Architecture

### Data Protection
- All data in transit encrypted via TLS
- Sensitive data at rest encrypted using AES-256
- PII data stored with field-level encryption

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with short expiration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- IP-based rate limiting
- Brute force protection

### Compliance Measures
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- FCRA-compliant dispute processing
- PCI DSS compliance for payment handling
- SOC 2 security controls

## Monitoring & Observability

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time metrics collection via Prometheus
- Custom dashboards in Grafana
- Alerting for performance anomalies

### Error Tracking
- Centralized error logging with Sentry
- Error categorization and prioritization
- Automated alerts for critical errors

### Audit Logging
- Comprehensive activity logging
- Tamper-evident log storage
- Compliance-ready audit trails

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- Automated daily database backups
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Cross-region backup replication

### Recovery Procedures
- Documented recovery processes
- Regular recovery testing
- Defined RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective)

## Development Workflow

### Code Organization
- Monorepo structure with clear separation of concerns
- Shared libraries for common functionality
- Feature-based organization within services

### Quality Assurance
- Automated testing at multiple levels (unit, integration, e2e)
- Code quality enforcement via ESLint and Prettier
- Pre-commit hooks for code standards

### Deployment Pipeline
- Feature branch development
- PR reviews and automated testing
- Staging deployment for verification
- Production deployment with rollback capability

## Future Extensibility

The architecture is designed to accommodate future growth and feature additions:

- **API Gateway**: Can be added for more complex routing and rate limiting
- **Machine Learning**: Infrastructure ready for ML-based violation detection
- **Mobile Applications**: API design supports native mobile clients
- **White-labeling**: Multi-tenant capabilities can be extended for white-label solutions
