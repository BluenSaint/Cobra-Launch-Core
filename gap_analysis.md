## Summary

The current implementation covers the basic structure of the project but requires significant expansion to meet the detailed specifications. Key areas requiring attention include:

1. Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
2. Expanded CI/CD workflows
3. Advanced backend features (Kafka, Redis, multi-engine OCR)
4. Billing integration
5. Admin section
6. Security hardening and compliance
7. Comprehensive documentation and handoff materials

The remediation plan will address these gaps systematically to ensure full compliance with the expanded requirements.
